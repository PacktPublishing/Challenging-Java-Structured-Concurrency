# Fixed number of producer/consumer threads
This problem reiterates the previous problem with a fixed number of producer/consumer threads greater than one.
 More exactly, use three producers and two consumers. Provide an implementation based
 on `newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()` and on based on `Semaphore`.
