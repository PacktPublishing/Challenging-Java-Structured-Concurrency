# Introducing `AtomicReference`
Atomic references are lock-free non-blocking algorithms that may 
successfully replace monitor-based synchronizations with optimistic locking 
for modifying a sharable (immutable) object (for instance, modify a cached value). 
Exemplify `AtomicReference` usage via several snippets of code.
