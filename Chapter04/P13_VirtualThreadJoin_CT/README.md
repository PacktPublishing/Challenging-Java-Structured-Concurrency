# Challenge time 
Do you remember the _Powerlifters_ application? In that scenario we discussed, 
two powerlifters participate simultaneously in the deadlift event. However, let's 
consider a situation where there is only one competition stand available. This 
means the powerlifters must take turns and perform their lifts sequentially 
instead of simultaneously. To simulate this behavior, how would we modify the code using the `join()` method?
