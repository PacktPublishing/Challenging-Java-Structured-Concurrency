# Challenge Time  
In this challenge, let’s assume that the queue of batteries can accommodate only 
10 batteries. If the workers process these batteries, then they have to wait for 
the queue to fill up. Once it is filled up, the workers may continue to process 
until the queue is depleted again. This scenario continues to repeat until the 
conveyor is stopped.
