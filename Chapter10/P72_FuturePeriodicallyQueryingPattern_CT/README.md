# Challenge time 
The previous code has two significant shortcomings. First, it stops after 50 pings 
regardless of whether the server successfully answers our requests. Second, the 
output is unintuitive, as the long values lack meaning for us. Challenge yourself 
to fix these two shortcomings and provide an output as follows: 

`Server ping unsuccessfully at: 11:01:41 | Next ping at: 11:01:44`  
`Server ping unsuccessfully at: 11:01:44 | Next ping at: 11:01:49`  
`Server ping unsuccessfully at: 11:01:49 | Next ping at: 11:01:56`
`Server ping successfully at: 11:01:56 | Next ping at: 11:02:05`
