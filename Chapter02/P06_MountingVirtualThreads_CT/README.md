# Challenge time 
Challenge yourself to execute a number of virtual threads (tasks) equal to the 
number of your CPU cores, using a parallelism of size CPU cores/2, and a pool of 
size parallelism/2. So, if you have 8 CPU cores, then execute 8 virtual threads 
(tasks) using a parallelism of 4 with a pool of 2.
